/*
Driver Nodelet setup

This choreography is based on the same primitives as the publisher subscriber setup, where nodelets 
can subscribe to topics. However, we do not distinguish between producers and subscribers here, and instead
have nodelets contain a controller and driver for specific hardware, which publishes topics to subscribe to and 
subscribes to other nodelets topics. Thus, we have an asynchronous setup where n nodelets subscribe to eachother and 
communicate over messages with eachother, and then interact with their respective hardware over commands.

Idea: define two global types, one for subscribing and one for communicating, and concatenate them.
